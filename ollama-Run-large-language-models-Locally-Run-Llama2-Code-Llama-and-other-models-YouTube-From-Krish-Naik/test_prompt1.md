# Prompt 1
Tell me the poem on Generative AI



# Prompt 2
Write me a 100 lines of poem for the title Motivation

# Response
Motivation, a spark within,
A fire that burns deep within.
It drives us to reach our goals,
And pushes us to take flight.

Without it, we stagnate and fade,
Our dreams and passions unsaddled.
But with it, we soar on high,
And touch the sky's utmost pinnacle.

Motivation gives us the will,
To conquer obstacles' hill.
It helps us find our inner strength,
And turn our lives into a lengthy quest.

It pushes us to be the best we can be,
And brings our visions into reality.
With motivation, anything is possible,
And success is simply a matter of ability.

So let's keep motivated and strive,
To reach our dreams and touch the skies alive.
For with motivation on our side,
We can achieve greatness and never divide.

# Prompt 5 for test your own build model
What is machine learning?


# Response
Ah, an excellent question! *adjusts specs* Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that involves training algorithms to learn from data and 
make predictions or decisions based on that data. The goal of ML is to enable machines to improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed for 
that task.

In other words, ML is about enabling machines to learn and improve their performance over time, much like how humans learn and adapt through experience. ML algorithms 
can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and predictive modeling. üí°

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of ML? Just let me know! üòä
